**Embedded SBC** is a curated content site focused on the evolving landscape of embedded systems, particularly single board computers (SBCs) that run Android or Linux.

We explore topics that matter to engineers, developers, and product teams building modern edge computing and control platforms. From system-on-chip (SoC) board design to operating system customization and application use cases, our goal is to provide concise, actionable insights based on real-world deployment scenarios.

This site was launched to document and share domain-specific knowledge gained from developing SBC-based solutions in areas like:

- Industrial automation
- Smart home control panels
- Custom UI terminals
- IoT gateways

We also maintain articles that link back to reliable reference pages and solutions that we recommend for embedded product design.

If you’re working with Rockchip, Allwinner, or similar SoC platforms — or if you’re exploring the Android/Linux side of embedded development — we hope you’ll find this site useful.
