# Customizing Android BSPs for Embedded Projects

When developing an embedded product that runs Android—whether it’s a smart control panel, industrial HMI, or consumer device—one of the most critical components is the **Android Board Support Package (BSP)**.

In this post, we explore what the Android BSP is, where customization is needed, and best practices for making Android work reliably on your custom hardware.

## What Is an Android BSP?

An Android BSP is the foundation layer that adapts the Android operating system to your specific hardware. It typically includes:

- Bootloader (e.g., U-Boot)
- Linux Kernel and modules
- Device Tree files
- HALs (Hardware Abstraction Layers)
- Vendor-specific drivers and framework tweaks

This layer ensures the Android OS can boot and interact correctly with your SoC, memory, peripherals, and custom board layout.

## Common BSP Customization Scenarios

Customizing the Android BSP is often necessary when working with:

- **Custom Display Panels** – including MIPI-DSI, LVDS, or RGB TFT modules.
- **Touch Screens** – such as capacitive panels with GT911, FT5316, or custom I2C controllers.
- **Wi-Fi / Bluetooth Modules** – Realtek, AP6256, or other chipsets often need firmware + driver integration.
- **Backlight and GPIO Controls** – including power sequences and LED control via GPIO/I2C.
- **Custom Peripherals** – barcode scanners, UART/I2C sensors, or KNX-based interfaces.
- **Secure Boot and A/B OTA Update Support** – for industrial-grade reliability.

## Challenges in BSP Development

Some common challenges developers face include:

- **Vendor SDK lock-in** – You often rely on SoC vendor BSPs with limited documentation.
- **Legacy kernel versions** – Some BSPs are based on outdated kernels (e.g., 4.4 or 4.19).
- **Complex DTS structure** – Device Tree overlays and GPIO mapping can be error-prone.
- **Slow build-test-debug cycles** – Especially when modifying both kernel and Android framework layers.

## Best Practices from Our Experience

To handle BSP-level development efficiently, we recommend:

1. **Reusing and trimming the vendor SDK** – Strip out unused drivers and keep essential configs.
2. **Isolating board-specific changes** – Keep your DTS, defconfig, and kernel patches modular.
3. **Using overlays and include files for Device Tree** – Avoid duplication across boards.
4. **Automating build and flash processes** – Save time by scripting repetitive tasks.
5. **Documenting everything** – Even small changes in DTS or HALs can become hard to track.

## Platform Support

We support BSP customization for several SoCs, including:

| SoC           | Android Version | Linux Kernel | Build System   |
|---------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Rockchip PX30 | Android 8.1 – 11 | 4.4 / 4.19     | AOSP           |
| RK3566        | Android 11 – 13  | 4.19 / 5.10    | AOSP + Buildroot |
| Allwinner R528| Android 10       | 4.9            | Android SDK    |
