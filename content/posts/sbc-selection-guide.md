# How to Choose the Right Single-Board Computer (SBC) for Your Project

Single-board computers (SBCs) come in all shapes, sizes, and capabilities. From simple automation tasks to AI-driven edge computing, choosing the right SBC can save development time, reduce cost, and ensure long-term reliability.

This guide outlines the key factors to consider when selecting the best SBC for your embedded or industrial project.

---

## 1. üéØ Define Your Application Requirements

Before looking at technical specs, ask:

- **What will the SBC do?** Data collection? Display UI? AI inference?
- **What environment will it run in?** Indoor, outdoor, harsh industrial?
- **What‚Äôs the lifecycle?** One-off prototype or long-term production?
- **Any size, temperature, or power constraints?**

> ‚úÖ Example: For a smart home controller, you might prioritize Wi-Fi, low power usage, and touchscreen support.

## 2. üß† Processing Performance

Choose a CPU that matches your task complexity:

| Task | Recommended SoC |
|------|------------------|
| Simple control logic | ARM Cortex-A7 or A55 |
| Multimedia & UI | Cortex-A72 or RK3566 |
| AI edge processing | SoC with NPU (e.g., RK3588) |

Also consider RAM size (1‚Äì8GB typical) and storage type (eMMC, SD, NVMe).

---

## 3. üîå I/O and Interfaces

Check the availability of:

- USB ports (2.0, 3.0)
- HDMI / LVDS / MIPI-DSI for displays
- GPIO, UART, I2C, SPI for sensors
- Ethernet (10/100/1000 Mbps)
- Audio in/out
- PCIe or M.2 for expansion

> üß© If your project requires camera input and real-time display, confirm CSI & DSI support.

---

## 4. üì∂ Networking & Wireless Connectivity

Must-have for most IoT and mobile applications:

- **Wi-Fi 2.4/5GHz** ‚Äî many SBCs have onboard chips or M.2 sockets
- **Bluetooth** ‚Äî often included with Wi-Fi
- **4G/5G** ‚Äî via USB dongle or SIM slot on advanced SBCs
- **Ethernet** ‚Äî always recommended for industrial reliability

---

## 5. üß∞ Software & OS Support

Ensure your target SBC supports:

- Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Buildroot)
- Android (for UI-intensive projects)
- Driver availability for peripherals
- SDKs and sample code

> üí° Rockchip-based SBCs often have Android and Linux dual support with active developer communities.

---

## 6. üèó Mechanical Size & Power

- **Form factor**: Credit card size (e.g., Raspberry Pi) or larger (3.5‚Äù or Pico-ITX)
- **Mounting**: DIN rail, VESA, panel-mount?
- **Power**: 5V vs 12V input; passive or active cooling?

> ‚ö†Ô∏è For battery-powered devices, power draw must be <5W ideally.

---

## 7. üí∞ Cost vs Longevity

Don‚Äôt just choose the cheapest SBC. Look at:

- Long-term availability (3+ years)
- Support for hardware revision tracking
- Documentation & community
- EOL (end-of-life) roadmap
