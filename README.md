## Introduction

Welcome to the Embedded-SBC Subsite GitHub repository, the official codebase behind Embedded-SBC.com. This repository hosts the source code, layouts, and workflows used to build and maintain a technical blog dedicated to Single Board Computers (SBCs), custom embedded systems, and the broader world of Android/Linux hardware platforms.

The site exists to fill a critical gap for engineers, product designers, and technology enthusiasts who want to understand not only what SBCs are, but also how they are applied in real-world industrial, IoT, and consumer use cases. Unlike generic articles on electronics, the content here is written with a strong technical foundation, featuring real design considerations, performance trade-offs, and product development workflows.

## What This Repository Contains

This GitHub repository provides the Hugo-based static site generator code for Embedded-SBC.com, including:
- Content: Markdown posts covering SBC definitions, overviews, comparisons, and detailed engineering notes.
- Layouts & Templates: Custom Hugo layouts optimized for readability, SEO, and technical documentation style.
- Static Assets: CSS, JavaScript, and images used to enhance performance and user experience.
- GitHub Actions Workflows: Automated builds and deployments to keep the site up to date.

The repository reflects a philosophy of open engineering communication. By publishing both content and code, this project demonstrates transparency in the way knowledge is built and shared.

## Why Focus on SBCs?

Single Board Computers have become essential to modern embedded design. They strike a balance between the raw simplicity of microcontrollers and the full flexibility of desktop-class processors.

On [this overview page](https://embedded-sbc.com/posts/sbc-overview/), we explain that SBCs combine CPU, memory, storage, and I/O into a compact form factor that can be used for:
- Industrial automation
- Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI)
- Smart home panels
- Edge AI devices
- Robotics and automation control
- Multimedia systems

With the rise of ARM-based SoCs, SBCs are now more powerful than ever, enabling complex applications on hardware that fits in the palm of your hand.

## Linux vs Android SBCs

A major focus of this subsite is the comparison between Linux SBCs and Android SBCs. While Linux has traditionally been dominant in the embedded space, Android-based boards are gaining traction thanks to their mature ecosystem, graphics support, and vast library of applications.

We cover this topic in detail in [Android SBC Overview](https://embedded-sbc.com/posts/android-sbc-overview/).

- **Linux SBCs**  
  - Great for headless or server-style workloads  
  - Flexible and secure, especially for industrial control  
  - Excellent for automation and IoT applications  

- **Android SBCs**  
  - Ideal for touch-based HMI and multimedia devices  
  - Vast ecosystem of applications  
  - Mature graphics and user interface stack  

By understanding their strengths and weaknesses, engineers can select the **right SBC for each application** instead of forcing a one-size-fits-all solution.

## Custom Embedded Systems

While off-the-shelf SBCs are powerful, they often need customization to perfectly match a product’s requirements. That is why custom embedded systems remain a core topic at Embedded-SBC.com.
On this dedicated article: [Custom Embedded Systems](https://embedded-sbc.com/posts/custom-embedded-systems/), we discuss:

- When to design a custom board vs adapting an existing SBC  
- Cost, power, and form factor trade-offs  
- The importance of Board Support Package (BSP) customization  
- Optimizing I/O for specific applications  

Benefits of custom SBC design include:

- Lower BOM cost in mass production  
- Power optimization for battery devices  
- Tailored form factor for enclosures  
- Longer software maintenance cycles  

This project provides **case studies** and **guidance** for making those decisions.

## Why Open Source Matters Here

The mission of this project is to democratize knowledge in embedded systems. By open-sourcing the code:

- Engineers can learn from the structure and apply it to their own sites.
- Contributors can propose new posts, corrections, or layout improvements.
- Transparency improves credibility for the content published on [Embedded-SBC.com](https://embedded-sbc.com/).

## Final Notes

This project is not a traditional software library. Instead, it is the backbone of a knowledge hub. The goal is to help engineers, product managers, and innovators understand embedded design in a way that is approachable, technically sound, and directly useful in real projects.

By combining practical blog content with transparent source code, we believe this project sets a new standard for technical publishing in the embedded systems space.

If you are working on embedded product design, exploring SBC platforms, or evaluating whether to build a custom embedded system, we encourage you to:
- Visit [https://embedded-sbc.com/](https://embedded-sbc.com/)
- Read the latest articles
- Fork this repo and adapt it for your own documentation needs

Together, let’s build a stronger open knowledge base for the future of embedded computing.
